### Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I'm having some trouble processing all the information since we are moving so fast and so I am opting out of doing the BONUS content in favor of completing Google Developer's Android Fundamentals CodeLabs to get a better understanding of what's going on. I will circle back around and complete the BONUS content soon for my own satisfaction.

### Open-source libraries used

- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/codepath/CPAsyncHttpClient) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
